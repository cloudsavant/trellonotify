## Terraform setup with GCP
### Create Service account
1. In the GCP Console, go to "IAM & Admin" â†’ "Service Accounts".
2. Create a new service account, and download the key as a JSON file.
2.1 For simplicity, we add project/editor role to this account. Later we can narrow it.
2.2 Create new key in JSON format
3. Set an environment variable named GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS pointing to the path of the downloaded JSON key.
4. Initialize your Terraform project using terraform init.
